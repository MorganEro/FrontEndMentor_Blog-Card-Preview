## My process

-Started with some reusable css rules then edited them to fit the project
-Used Utopia to create some responsive rules for type and spacing
-Created CSS styles and classes
-Created the html and linked the stylesheet
-Modified the styles to match the design pattern as closely as possible

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to thoroughly examine the figma design patterns and the design preview. I was using the responsive figma design as my source for matching my project and later realized that the figma design pattern didn't match the expected design. This wasted a lot of my time.

I also noticed that the character spacing for the fonts that came with the assets was incorrect at first. After importing the google fonts and using that, the spacing was better. I will continue to use google fonts instead of the provided ones from now on.

### Continued development

I will continue working on responsive text and spacing. It is more complex than I initially thought and I am enjoying the rabbit hole it has lead me down.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://utopia.fyi/) - This helped me a lot with responsive text and spacing
- [Resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4u1yp3Msao) - This is an awesome video by Kevin Powell. It is filled with a lot of great information that I will be implementing in my work.
